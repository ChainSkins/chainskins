## 1. Overview

The Extension Wallet is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to:

* Generate and manage a crypto wallet using a password of their choice.

This Extension is designed with full client-side privacy. All sensitive operations are performed locally within the user's browser environment.

## 2. Key Features & Responsibilities

* **Non-custodial Architecture**: We do not store, access, or transmit private keys, passwords, or mnemonic phrases.
* **Client-side Encryption**: The user's mnemonic and private keys are encrypted and stored locally in the Extension's browser storage. Only the user can access them.
* **Password-Based Access**: Users choose a password to encrypt their wallet. This password is never stored or transmitted.
* **Transaction Signing**: Smart contracts are signed locally in the Extension. When necessary, the user voluntarily provides their private key and password for the purpose of signing a transaction. This process occurs entirely in-memory and is never logged or stored.
* **Steam Integration**: The Extension uses Steam OAuth solely to verify ownership of a Steam account. No sensitive data from Steam is stored beyond what is required for trade verification.
