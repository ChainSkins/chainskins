# chainskins.net – Terms and Conditions

_Last updated: June 20, 2025_

Welcome to chainskins.net ("Platform", "we", "our", or "us"). By using this site, you ("User", "you") agree to the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.

---

### 1. Introduction  
chainskins.net is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace for buying and selling CS2 skins using cryptocurrency. We act solely as a neutral middleman that verifies and co-signs smart contracts between buyers and sellers. We do not take custody of any items or funds.

### 2. Platform Usage  
- Users are solely responsible for their actions and transactions.  
- All trades occur via smart contracts requiring two signatures: the buyer’s and ours (as validator).  
- You must be at least 18 years old to use this service.

### 3. Legal Status  
chainskins.net is an online tool and platform provided without establishing a formal legal entity or company. The service operates in beta and does not act as a custodian of funds or items.

By using this Platform, you acknowledge that chainskins.net functions purely as a neutral facilitator for smart contract transactions and does not assume responsibility beyond that role.

### 4. No Custody Disclaimer  
chainskins.net does **not**:  
- Hold cryptocurrency on behalf of users.  
- Custody CS2 items at any point.  
- Guarantee the outcome of any transaction.

You acknowledge that all assets are held in multisig smart contracts and you retain control of your keys.

### 5. Crypto Wallets & Security  
- Users connect via a browser extension-based crypto wallet.  
- Wallet keys are encrypted with a user-selected password and a server-side master key.  
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password.

### 6. Limitations of Liability  
We are **not liable** for:  
- Losses due to hacked wallets, weak passwords, phishing, or human error.  
- Malfunction of the Ethereum or applicable blockchain network.  
- Disputes between buyers and sellers beyond our technical role.

### 7. Prohibited Use  
You agree not to:  
- Use the Platform for illegal or fraudulent purposes.  
- Attempt to exploit or reverse-engineer the system.  
- Violate CS2's or Steam’s terms of use.

### 8. Suspension and Termination  
We reserve the right to suspend access or ban users who:  
- Violate these terms.  
- Engage in suspicious or malicious activity.  
- Are subject to legal or regulatory restrictions.

### 9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction  
For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the laws of **Estonia** shall govern this agreement. This choice of jurisdiction is made as a legal reference to provide clarity on applicable law and does not imply that chainskins.net is a registered company or entity in Estonia or any other jurisdiction.

Users agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Estonia for any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms.

### 10. Important Clarification

Although these Terms and Conditions state that the laws of Estonia govern this agreement, chainskins.net remains solely an online tool and platform without any formal legal entity or company registration.

This means chainskins.net does not operate as a registered business, does not assume responsibilities typical of a company, and functions only as a neutral facilitator for smart contract transactions during its beta phase.


### 11. Modifications  
We may modify these Terms. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised date. Continued use of the Platform after changes indicates acceptance.
