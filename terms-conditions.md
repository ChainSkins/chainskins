# chainskins.net â€“ Terms and Conditions

_Last updated: July 16, 2025_

Welcome to chainskins.net ("Platform", "we", "our", or "us"). By using this site, you ("User", "you") agree to the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.

---

### 1. Introduction

chainskins.net is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace for buying and selling CS2 skins using cryptocurrency. We act solely as a **neutral facilitator** that verifies and co-signs smart contracts between buyers and sellers. We **do not take custody** of any items or funds at any time.

---

### 2. Platform Usage

- You are solely responsible for your wallet, transactions, and smart contract interactions.
- Trades occur via self-executing smart contracts requiring the signatures of both parties (buyer and seller) and our co-signature for validation.
- You must be at least **18 years old** to use this Platform.

---

### 3. Legal Nature of the Platform

chainskins.net is provided as an **online tool** during its beta phase. It is **not a registered legal entity**, nor does it operate as a licensed financial or custodial service.

By using the Platform, you acknowledge that chainskins.net is only a neutral technical layer and does not act as an intermediary in the legal or custodial sense.

---

### 4. No Custody Disclaimer

chainskins.net does **not**:

- Hold cryptocurrency on behalf of users
- Hold or escrow CS2 items
- Control the outcome of trades or disputes

All trades are executed through **non-custodial multisig smart contracts**, and users retain full control of their keys and wallets.

---

### 4.1 Escrow and Multisig

The system uses multisig contracts requiring signatures from the buyer, seller, and a neutral third party ("middleman") to release funds.

- The multisig escrow private key is stored encrypted on our servers and can only be used to sign transactions when all parties have previously signed and conditions are met (such as confirmation of item delivery and acceptance, or expiration of a 7-day waiting period).
- The middleman acts solely as a neutral arbitrator without unilateral control to move funds.
- Users accept this structure by using the Platform and understand that the system depends on cooperation among parties to release or cancel funds.

---

### 4.2 Waiting Period and Release of Funds

- Users agree that once a trade is initiated, funds will be held in escrow for a minimum waiting period of **7 calendar days** to allow for the confirmation of item delivery and acceptance, or cancellation.
- The release or refund of funds after this period requires the signatures of the buyer, seller, and middleman as part of the multisig process.
- By using the Platform, you explicitly consent to this waiting period and the conditional release mechanism, acknowledging that this process is integral to the safe and fair operation of the marketplace.
- The waiting period and release conditions are clearly reflected in the smart contracts governing each transaction.

---

### 5. Crypto Wallets & User Responsibility

- Users connect via browser-based crypto wallets.
- Wallet data is encrypted using the user's password and a server-side master key.
- We cannot access, recover, or reset wallet credentials.
- Users are responsible for securing their own access credentials.

---

### 6. Limitation of Liability

chainskins.net is not liable for:

- Losses from hacked wallets, user error, phishing, or scams
- Failures in the blockchain network
- Disputes or failed trades between users
- Downtime, bugs, or beta-phase malfunctions

Use the Platform at your own risk.

### 7. Prohibited Use

Users agree not to:

- Use the Platform for any illegal or fraudulent purpose
- Violate Steam's or CS2's terms of service

### 8. Account Suspension & Bans

We reserve the right to suspend or ban users who:

### 9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the laws of the country where the Platform operator resides shall govern this agreement. Users agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in that country for any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms.

This choice reflects the actual place of operation and legal domicile of the Platform operator, ensuring clarity and enforceability.

---

### 10. Disclaimer on Legal Status

chainskins.net is **not a company, business, or legal entity**. It functions purely as a neutral and experimental tool to facilitate P2P smart contract-based trades.

You acknowledge and accept the experimental and non-commercial nature of the Platform.

---

### 11. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. Updates will be posted here with a revised date. Continued use of the Platform implies acceptance of any changes.
